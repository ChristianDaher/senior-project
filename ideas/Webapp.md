# Web Application Development

This section is dedicated to ideas and discussions related to both the backend and frontend of our web application. 

## Guidelines

Please adhere to the following when contributing:

- **UI/UX Design**: Suggestions for the user interface and user experience design.
- **APIs**: Ideas for necessary APIs, their design, and implementation.
- **Page Flow**: Proposals for the flow of web pages, user navigation, etc.
- **Authentication**: Ideas and strategies for user authentication and authorization.
- **Model Integration**: Connect application to trained model with a framework (preferably FastAPI). When user inputs data on the website, a POST request will be sent to the model, outputting a prediction.
- **Admin Page**: An admin page where authentication is retrieved from a database.
- **Database Management**: The database will save inputs such as the value, the data. In the Admin dashboard, there will be visualizations of the inputs. We have two tables in the database, one for Credentials and one for the log data.
- **Web Application Structure**: The web application will have three pages:
  - **Home Page**: Introduction to our project, the model, the success rate, etc.
  - **Prediction Page**: This page will contain user inputs where a person can make predictions.
  - **Admin Page**: This page will only be accessed by pressing the Login button.
