# Machine Learning

This section is dedicated to discussions and ideas related to machine learning models, data analysis, and visualization.

## Guidelines

When contributing, please consider the following categories:

- **Data Acquisition**: Suggestions for obtaining various data types (CSV, API, Database SQL MYSQL).
- **ETL Process**: Ideas for data formatting and handling missing data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Proposals for data analysis techniques.
- **Feature Engineering and Pre-processing**: Ideas for feature engineering and pre-processing strategies.
- **Model Validation Techniques**: Suggestions for various model validation techniques.
- **Model Selection**: Test 2 to 3 models, providing explanations for the chosen models. The model should be time efficient.
- **Model Training**: Suggestions for training machine learning models, including algorithms, libraries, and techniques.
- **Data Analysis**: Ideas for data interpretation.
- **Data Visualization**: Proposals for effective data and results visualization techniques.
- **AI Concepts**: Discussions related to AI concepts that can enhance our machine learning models.

### Idea 1 - Model Concepts

#### Ensembling Techniques
- Boosting
- Bagging
- Stacking

#### Data Preprocessing
- PCA (Primarily for Unsupervised Learning)
- Dimension Reduction
- Feature Engineering
- One Hot Encoding
- Outlier Detection

#### Model Tuning
- Fine Tuning
- Hyperparameter Tuning

#### Model Selection
- Model Selection Methods (For example, holdout method and k-fold cross-validation. More details can be found [here](./Model%20selection.txt))

#### Other Concepts
- Loss Functions
- Regularization (Does the model or the models we use need regularization?)

#### Theory

Our model is based on supervised learning as it has both input and output. It is also numerical, meaning we rely on models like KNN, Regression, Decision Tree, GX Boost, SVM etc. These are classification models.

We should evaluate the pros and cons of a model, based on items such as the number of features and which models work best. More details can be found in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUUSamG4P80&ab_channel=Siddhardhan).
